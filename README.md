## Summary

Tucson Bike Yourself app allows users to search for bike routes in Tucson.  
Users can input the start and ending locations.  Once the users click 
the search button, the landing page disappears and the map of the search 
appears with the bike route and weather.  The map also indicates traffic and 
dedicated bike routes and lanes.  The save route feature allows users to save 
current bike route.  

## More Description
The problem with the app was to make the route appears.  Using the Google initMap function,
directionsService, directionsDisplay, and the longitude and latitude of the start and ending 
locations, the route was able to be calculated and shown on the map.
